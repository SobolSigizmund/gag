/**
 * <h1>Literary Annotations</h1>
 * Annotations to help express yourself literarily.
 * These speak for themselvesâ€¦ so to speak.
 * Don't let another haiku or oxymoron go by again without slapping on one of these bad boys.
 * You'll forever be revered for your code style and your code <em>style</em>.
