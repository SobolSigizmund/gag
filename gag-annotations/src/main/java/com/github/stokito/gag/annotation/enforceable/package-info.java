/**
 * <h1>Enforceable Annotations</h1>
 * Annotations that are enforceable by the GagTransformer agent.
 * Enforceable Annotations are annotations enforced by dynamic bytecode instrumentation.
 * Use the following annotations, then run your applications with the <code>javaagent:gag-agent.jar</code> option (see the <code>README</code> for details), and, voila, your annotations get enforced at runtime.
