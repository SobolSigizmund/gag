/**
 * <h1>Remark Annotations</h1>
 * Comments in Javadocs â€” who reads them? Annotations are so fashion-forward.
 * Nothing catches attention like a good {@link OhSnap} or {@link FTW}.
 * Doing a code review? You can mix and match Remark annotations to effect a healthy smack down.
 * <p/>
 * Annotations to praise your own code and smirk at others.
